# About this project

This is the front end part of the seller app just like a car rental app.

# Features

in this app i've provided the information about different cars in cards
format.
i have provided details of 60 cars.
in this app functionalities like pagination and search feature are workable
only on page 1 for now.

# Note

in search feature i found an error of it only works on first page,
im trying to fix it soon.
i have used random image for most of the cars after first page,
so if you feel like image is not rendering or taking time to render then wait
for some time or just refresh the page.
